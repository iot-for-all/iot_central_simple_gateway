# iot_central_simple_gateway

Illustrates how to register devices to a simple gateway device so they are related in IoT Central

This is a simple sample that shows how to write a very simple gateway that registers itself with IoT Central and then registers three leaf devices (devices connected to the gateway) to IoT Central and forms a relationship between the leaf device and the gateway.  The end result of this is that the leaf devices will show up in IoT Central UX like this:
